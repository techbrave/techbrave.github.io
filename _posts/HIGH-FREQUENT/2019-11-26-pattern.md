# Array
- [Sliding Window](https://techbrave.github.io/zhuanti/2019/11/09/sliding-window-mock.html)
- [Two pointers](https://techbrave.github.io/zhuanti/2019/10/31/two-pointers-mock.html)
- [Cyclic Sort](https://techbrave.github.io/zhuanti/2019/11/09/cyclic-sort.html)

# Linked list
- Fast & Slow pointer
- In place reversal of a linked list

# Tree / Graph
- [Tree BFS](https://techbrave.github.io/zhuanti/2019/11/03/tree-bfs.html)
- [Tree DFS](https://techbrave.github.io/zhuanti/2019/11/02/tree-dfs-mock.html)

# Backtrack / recurssion
- [Subset](https://techbrave.github.io/zhuanti/2019/11/05/recurssion-mock.html)

- k-way merge

# Dynamic programming
- 0/1 knapsack

# Domain
- Topology sort

- If the given input is a sorted (list, array matrix), consider using a variable of Binary Search or two pointer strategy

- If a problem has a brute force solution using O(n^2) time and O(1) space, there must exist two other solutions: 1) using a Map or a Set, for O(n) time and O(n) space / Using sorting for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

- If we are dealing with top/max/min/closest 'k' elements among n elements, use a Heap

- If we need to try out all combinations (or permutations) of the input, use recursive backtracking or iterative Breadth first search

- For most questions related to Tree or graph, it can be solved by using bread-first search, or depth first search 

- Every recursive solution can be converted to an iterative solution using a stack

- If the problem is asking about optimization(e.g. maximization, or minimization), consider dynamic programming 

- If we need to find common substring among a set of strings, we will be using a hashMap or a Trie

- If we need to search among a bunch of strings, Trie could be good datastructure

- If the problem involves LinkedList, and we cannot use extra space, we can use "fast-slow" pointer

> 基础：

# Graph
- Graph traversal (Breadth first search, iterative, with queue)
- Graph traversal (Depth first search, iterative, with stack)
- Graph traversal (Depth first search, recursive, using recursive method)

- [Kosaraju's Algorithm Graph (Strongly Connected Component)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpgcYiky7uw)
> Definition: What is a strongly connected component? In the mathematical theory of directed graphs, a graph is said to be strongly connected or diconnected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. 
> Intuition, why would Kosaraju's algorithm work? Let's vertually group all the scc into a bigger vertext. Now the original graph is transformed into anothe graph, that is directed acyclic. Proof: if there were a cycle, we could have group more vertices into a new (bigger) virtual vertext. which violates the assumption.
