# Overview
What are big companies looking for?
1. 理解问题
2. 代码基础功力
3. 基础数据结构/算法
4. 逻辑思维/算法优化能力
5. 细节处理(corner case)
6. 算法分析(时间/空间复杂度)
7. debug能力

# Summarization
We can use the following interview guidelines
## UNDERSTAND AND CLARIFY 
- Communication, understand the problem statement, and ask any clarifying questions
- Define the API signature, and again use this signature to verify the understanding
- If stucked (not able to get to any solution yet). Try to walk through the example given, and again understand the problem. 
- Try to propose some solution at this point (however native it could be), and ask for help if not able to improve

## PROPOSE SOLUTION
- Propose a solution. If we're using any datastructure, algorithms, try to explain why we want to use them.
- Walk through one example, write how each step will work, even with some pseudo code
- Clarify with interviewer if this is what they want. if yes, begin coding. if not ask what can be improved 

## CODE, FIND BUG, TEST
- Implement the actual logic in the proposed API 
- Find bugs (important!)
- walk through a few more test cases

## TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY 
- analyze the time and space complexity

## FOLLOW-UP
- if there are follow-ups, try to answer
