# Design problems in general

## Algorithsm and Data structures
Identify the basic algorithsm and data structures

## Decomposition
Split the functionality, architecture and codes into managable and re-usable components

## Scalability 
Break the problem into sub-problems, that can be solved relatively independently on different machines. Share data across machine to make it. 
Decouple the servers that handle reads from writes. Use replication across the read server to gain performance. Consider caching computation and later look it up to save work.
