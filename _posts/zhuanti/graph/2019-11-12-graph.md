# Dijkstra Algorighm (greedy)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB4MIexjvY0&vl=en

> What can it do?
- Find the shortest path in a directed, or un-directed graph from a single source

> repeating process (start from s, find the shortest distance from s to any other vertexes(u))
- Initialize the representation, `d[u]` means the shortest distance so far from s to u. Initially, `d[s] = 0, d[u]=c(s,u)|u is neighbor of s, d[other]=INF`
- Repeating step, while we have not visited all vertxes, do
  - select the vertex `u` that has the shortest distance to s (minHeap), mark this vertex as visited
  - Relaxation: for all the neighbor of `u` (namely `v`), if `v` is already visited, ignore; other wise, check d[u]+c[u,v]; If `d[u]+c[u,v] < d[v], d[v] = d[u]+c[u,v]`

> Timecomplexity
- worst case `Theta(V * V)`, performing on all |V| vertexes, and when relaxing, ? all V connected gets relaxed
  
> Drawback
When the graph has negative edges, it may, or maynot work!

# Bellman ford (dynamic programming)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtN3BYH2Zes

> what can it do?
- Find the shortest path in a directed path from a single source

> Try out all possible (relaxation, n-1 times)
- Initialization: maintain a distance map, source vertex d = 0, all other vertex = INF
- Repeating the following percedure for `(n-1)` times, `n` is the number of the vertex
    - Loop over each edge `(u,v)`, and try to apply relaxiation, that is: `if d[u]+c[u,v] < d[v], d[v] = d[u]+c[u,v]`

> Timecomplexity
- O(E * V), so for all the edges, we try to relax them
- Worst case, complete graph `O(n^3)

> Drawback
When the graph has a cycle with negative edges, it will not work. However, we can use Bellman ford to detect whether the graph has cycle or not. So, after performing (n-1) times relaxation, we can do it one more time. If any of the distance gets updated, we could identify that a cycle exists.
