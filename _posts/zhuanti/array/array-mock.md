# What is an array
An  also referred to as a collection of elements is the simplest and most widely used Data Structure. Most of the Data Structures (e.g.Stack and Queue) were derived using the Array structure, which is why it is known as one of the central building blocks of Data Structures. 

# How is array stored in memory 
By object reference. 

object array holds the reference to each object, primitive array store the value of each element (in heap).

# Two dimensional array 
A Two Dimensional Array is an array, that each element holds the reference to another 1D array.
