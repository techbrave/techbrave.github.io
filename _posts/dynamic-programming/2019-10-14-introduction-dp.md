summary: in this post, we introduce the motivation behind "dynamic programming" concept. 

# 动机-一个门外汉的理解
Usually, solving and fully understanding a dynamic programming problem is a 4 step process:

- Start with the recursive backtracking solution
- Optimize by using a memoization table (top-down3 dynamic programming)
- Remove the need for recursion (bottom-up dynamic programming)
- Apply final tricks to reduce the time / memory complexity
