# JVM

A java program is complied into Bytecode. Unlike C or C++, they are compiled into machine languages. 

Bytecode is a platform independent instruction set, that can be executed by an interpreter. An interpretor is also a program, which is often written in C or C++
JVM, is a kind of interpretor. It interprete the bytecode generated by the Java compiler (javac)

Pros:
- Same bytecode can run unchanged on multiple platforms. It reduces the burden to port a language to a new platform. 
Cons:
- performance hit. becuase of the added layer of indirection. It has significantly been improved, by just-in-time-compilation, wherein the JVM identifies at run0tim code sections that are most commonly executed, and generates native machine code for those sections. 

[Java Memory Leak Understand](https://www.baeldung.com/java-memory-leaks)
One of the core benefits of Java is the automated memory management with the help of the built-in Garbage Collector (or GC for short). The GC implicitly takes care of allocating and freeing up memory and thus is capable of handling the majority of the memory leak issues.

While the GC effectively handles a good portion of memory, it doesn't guarantee a foolproof solution to memory leaking.
