Summary: List problems often have `O(n)` brute force space solutions, but subtler solution using the existing list nodes to reduce space complexity to `O(1)`

# Library and syntax

In Python, a list is an ordered sequence of heterogeneous elements. In other words, a list can hold elements with different data types. `[1, "hi"]`

So lists can hold integers, strings, characters, functions, and pretty much any other data type including other lists simultaneously! `anotherList = [aList, 'Python', foo, ['yet another list']]` list indices start from 0.


## List initialization
```python
l1 = [1, "hi"]
l2 = list(range(10))
l3 = []
```
## Important methods on Python lists
The following methods, have detailed time complexity list in [Python Wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity).
Although it is called "list", the underlying implementation is just dynamic arrays, which is why "insert" and "delete" takes `O(n)` time.

Actually, different underlying implementation maybe using different techniques. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3917574/how-is-pythons-list-implemented)

CPython uses an array of pointers, Jython uses an ArrayList, IronPython apparently also uses an array. You can browse the source code to find out. Thus they all have O(1) random access.

```python
# Use append function to add a single element to the end of a list. This function works in 
l = [1, 3, 5, 'seven']
l.append(9)

# Inserts element to the list. Use it like list.insert(index, value). It works in O(n)
l.insert(0, 5) # insert element '5' at the beginning

# Removes the given element from the list. Use it like list.remove(element). It works in O(n)O(n). If the element does not exist, you will get a runtime error.
l.remove(1)
l.remove(100)

# Removes the element at given index. If no index is given, then it removes the last element. So list.pop() would remove the last element. This works in O(1)O(1). list.pop(2) would remove the element with index 2, i.e., 55 in this case. Also, popping an intermediate element takes O(k)O(k) time where k < n
l.pop()
l.pop(1)

# This function reverses lists. Use it like so, list.reverse(). This one is in O(n)
l.reverse()
print(l)
```
## Slicing 
Accessing and modifying several elements from objects such as lists/tuples/strings requires using a for loop in most languages. However, in Python, you can use square brackets and a colon like so `l[start:end]`, `start` inclusive, `end` exclusive

```python
List = list(range(10))
print(List) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
print(List[0:4]) # 0, 1, 2, 3
print(List[3:]) # 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
print(List[:3]) # 0 1 2
print(List[:]) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

# stepping in slicings l[start:stop:end]
print(List[0:9:2]) # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
print(List[9:0:-2]) # 9, 7, 5, 3, 1

# initializing list elements
x = list(range(5))
print(x) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
x[1:4] = [45,21,83]
print(x) # 0, 45, 21, 83, 4

# deleting elements
List = list(range(4))
print(List) # 0, 1, 2, 3
del List[::2]
print(List) # 1, 3

# navigate elements
List = list(range(10))
print(List[4:-1]) # 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

# slicing in strings
my_string = "somehow"
string1 = my_string[:4]
string2 = my_string[4:]
print(string1, string2)
```
