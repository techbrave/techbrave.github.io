title: Java - Lists

Summary: List problems often have `O(n)` brute force space solutions, but subtler solution using the existing list nodes to reduce space complexity to `O(1)`

## Java library and syntax

```java
The key methods for the List interface 
List<T> list 
list.add('abc');
list.add(2, 3.1);
list.addAll(list2);
list.clear();
list.contains('str');
list.get(0);
list.indexOf(358);
list.isEmpty();
list.iterator();
list.remove(12);
list.removeAll(list3);
list.set(3, 4.25);
list.sublist(1, 5);
list.toArray();
```

Two common Java interfaces: `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. Note some operation is very expensive on array list, for example `add(i, 1.5)` on `ArrayList`. 

Java `Collections` has very useful methods

```java
Collections.addAll(C,1,2,4);
Collections.binarySearch(list,42);
Collections.fill(list, "f");
Collections.swap(C,8,1);
Collections.min(C);
Collections.min(C, cmp);
Collections.max(C);
Collections.reverse(list);
Collections,sort(list);
Collections,sort(list, cmp);
```

Tip:` Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3)`  which can be very helpful, in interview, because it saves a lot of time. 

### Even-Odd merge

Problem: lets say you are given a singly-linked list, which is `0-1-2-3-4`, we want to make it such that all the even nodes appear in the first half, `0-2-4-1-3`. How would you do it? 

A very naive idea, is to allocate new nodes and compute two new lists, one for the even and one for the odd nodes. The result is the first list concatenated with the second list. The time and space complexity are both 0(n).

However, do we need to create new nodes, or do we just need to re-arrange connection relationships between existing nodes?

Lets say we create two "new" list, in the sense that it represent the even list, and the odd list. whenever we have a new`curr` node (`curr`is a pointer, and it means the current node we are traversing) , we decide whether to put it at the end of `even `list or `odd` list.

```java
// evenDummy.next = evenHeadNode
// oddDummy.next = oddDummyNode 
// evenNode is the tail node of `even` list
// oddNode is the tail node of `odd` list
public static ListNode<Integer> evenOddMerge(ListNode<Integer> head) {
    if (head == null || head.size() < 2) return head;
    List<ListNode> tails = new ArrayList<>();
    tails.add(new ListNode(0, null)); tails.add(new ListNode(0, null));
    ListNode oddHead = head.next;
    ListNode curr =  head;
    boolean isEven = true;
    while (curr != null) {
      if (isEven) {
        tails.get(0).next = curr;
        tails.set(0, curr);
      } else {
        tails.get(1).next = curr;
        tails.set(1, curr);
      }
      curr = curr.next;
      isEven = !isEven;
    }
    tails.get(1).next = null;
    tails.get(0).next = oddHead;
    return head;
  }
```
