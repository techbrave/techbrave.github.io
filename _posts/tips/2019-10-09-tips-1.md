# Watering Flowers ⭐⭐⭐ [New Grad]

[Post Link](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/394347/)

Problem: 
You and your friend are using water cans to water flowers. Each flower requires `x` liter of water. All flowers are lined up in a line. 

Rules:
0. You and your friend's water cans are both empty when started. 
1. You start at the left side of flower line, your friend starts at the right side of flower line. Both of you start to water at the same time. 
2. You have a water can with capacity `capacity1`, that can hold `capacity1` liter of water. Similarly, your friend has a water can with capacity `capacity2`, that can hold `capacity2` liter of water. 
3. When watering, each flower has to be water once and you cannot re-fill your water can during one watering. It means that before you attempt to water one flower, your water can need to have `c1 >= flowers[i]` liter of water. Otherwise, you need to refill
4. If you and your friend happen to be watering the same flower while you and friend happen to have enough water together, no refilling is required. If you two together does not have enough water, only one refill is required (from either of you)

Output:
return the number of times, you and your friend need. 

Solution:
It is a typical simulation problem, very straight forward, applying [two pointer pattern](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview/xlK78P3Xl7E). 

```java
public class WaterFlowersII { 
    public static int refills(int[] w, int capacity1, int capacity2) {
        int c1 = 0;
        int c2 = 0;
        int res = 0;

        int i = 0, j = w.length - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            if (c1 < w[i]) {
                res++; // refill
                c1 = capacity1;
            }
            c1 = c1 - w[i];
            i++;
            if (c2 < w[j]) {
                res++;
                c2 = capacity2;
            }
            c2 = c2 - w[j];
            j--;
        }

        if (i == j) {
            if (c1 + c2 < w[i]) res++;
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```

# Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row ⭐⭐⭐ [New Grad]

[Post Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-domino-rotations-for-equal-row/)

Problem: In a row of dominoes, A[i] and B[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the i-th domino.  (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the i-th domino, so that A[i] and B[i] swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in A are the same, or all the values in B are the same.

If it cannot be done, return -1.


Idea: 
Rotate every element not equal to `val` from `array2` to `array1`, if any such rotation fail, return -1
Try all value from `1` to `6`
 
```java
class Solution {
    public int minDominoRotations(int[] A, int[] B) {
        if (A.length != B.length) return -1; // not equal length
        
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int k = 1; k<= 6; k++) {
            int cnt1 = rotate(A, B, k);
            if (cnt1 != -1) {
                min = Math.min(cnt1, min);
            }
            int cnt2 = rotate(B, A, k);
            if (cnt2 != -1) {
                min = Math.min(cnt2, min);
            }
        }
    
        if (min == Integer.MAX_VALUE) return -1;
        return min;
    }
    
    // for every element, a1[i], 
    // if a1[i] == val, no ops
    // else, we try to rotate, by swapping value from a2[i], to a1[i]
    //   if a2[i] != val, return -1 (no rotation can be done)
    //   cnt++
    private int rotate(int[] a1, int[] a2, int val) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a1.length; i++) {
            if (a1[i] != val) {
                if (a2[i] != val) return -1; 
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
