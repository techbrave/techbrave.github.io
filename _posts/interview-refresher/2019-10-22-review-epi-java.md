# Preparing a technical interview in just a couple days?

My plan is to briefly go over all the key concepts on first two days, and dive deep into common patterns on next couple days, finally prep for resume projects/system design/white-boarding on last two days. 

# Data Structures

- Primitive 
- Arrays
- String
- List
- Stack and Queues
- Binary Trees
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Binary Search Trees 

# Algorithms

[Post](https://techbrave.github.io/epi_java/2019/08/19/algorithms.html)

- Sorting (quick select partition etc.)
- Two pointers
```
    Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
    Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
    Reverse Words in a String II
    Rotate Array
    Valid Palindrome
    Container With Most Water
    Product of Array Except Self

```
- Divide and Conquer
- Recusion (DFS + backtracking)
```
    Applicable: searching, enumeration, divide and conquer, and decomposing a complex problem into a set of similar smaller instancesâ€¦
```
- BFS + Topological sort
